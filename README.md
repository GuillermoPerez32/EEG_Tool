The EEG_Tool is a GUI interface for the iEEG to BIDS format based on [EEG2BIDS](https://github.com/aces/EEG2BIDS) and is used with LORIS (Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System). Users can use their LORIS credentials with a LORIS URL and automatically retrieve LORIS data for the EEG to BIDS format. Becareful to remove your login credentials after using EEG2BIDS on a shared computer!
